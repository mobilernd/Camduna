# Camduna

This is a simple test from Camduna about using java rest APi .

Clone the repository into your local machine and run tests in the file name ClientDataApiTesting .



# First test function is 

public void shouldReturnUsersNumbers() 
    
It will total number of users in the resposne .

# second test function is 

public void shouldReturnTureForFirstUserName()  

It will tell us if the first user name is george or not .

Please note that , i used Maven Jackson in this demo example .

Of course , there are a dime a dozens of libraries that could do the same task .
